\section*{Preface}
18.905/906 is being taught by Professor Haynes Miller in Fall 2016/Spring 2017 (respectively). I am planning on taking notes throughout the semester. I'll add drawings by putting them on a notepad, scanning them as images, and finally inserting them in the appropriate spots. This means that they might be messy. Any mistakes in these notes are only mine, and not Professor Miller's.

Here are hyperlinks to the notes from each of the semesters.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The notes for 18.905 start at section \ref{905}.
        \item The notes for 18.906 start at section \ref{906}.
    \end{enumerate}

\section*{Stuff to fix}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The original version of the notes used
	\verb|\cc| to denote both a script C and the complex numbers.
	Now, \verb|\cc| denotes a script C and \verb|\cC| denotes the complex numbers.
	Everytime you find this, edit it!
    \item Be consistent about your use of $\Hom_\cc(C,D)$ and $\cc(C,D)$ for hom-sets.
\end{itemize}
